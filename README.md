# Za Mercury Workshaa Pwoxy!

The build process is sort of cancer, BUT you'll live, I promise.

# First things first
Make sure all your submodules are cloned, got it? yes, if you didn't clone recurivsley you're dumbo, if not, bombastic! \

You'll want to
```bash
cd bcc-tls/wstcp/
```
This is a good time to make sure your rust toolchain is installed, liberal. YOuu'll need it to kompile expoy! (PS: have wasm-bindgen installed too <3)
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```
woooo okay you just compiled epoxy, I bet you're feeling glad now! Lets compile bcc-tls now
```
cd ..
pnpm install
pnpm build
```
Hell yeah sister!! you just compiled bcc-tls! Now we can move on to Mercury Proxy, our favorite least favorite ALICEJS APP!!
```
cd ..
pnpm install
```
Wowzers! You're ready to run it now now you little shit! run `pnpm dev`
